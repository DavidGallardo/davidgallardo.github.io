WeFoundaRobot is a small travel blog that tells a story about how <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/airidordas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airí</a> & Myself traveled the world trying to find a small droid that is always a step ahead. The idea of writing about our adventures came from two main reasons: First, keep family & friends up-to-date about our trip and second, to return to the internet some <a href="https://wefoundarobot.com/consejos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tips & tricks</a> we learned the hard way during the journey. We have returned already, but we still trying to upload as many info as we can, but at a different pace. Next trips will be added soon, so keep on eye on <a href="https://wefoundarobot.com">it</a>.

## The style. Binary letters from another planet.
  
Instead of posting about *the best 10 places to visit somewhere*, we decided to change the perspective a little bit. The format became an exchange of letters between a droid that's wandering on our planet and us, trying to catch him. Changing the point of view allowed to talk not just about how was our time but many other things such as politics, food, weather or fashion in a totally different way.

## Statistics. Fun data about our travels. 

We thought that would be fun to have a small dashboard with highlighted information about the trip. Some of that would be just big numbers about extreme temperature, distance covered, public transport.. but we added other more personal stuff like books we've been reading, songs, favourite dishes or budget.

## Training abroad. New technology, fresh design.

We didn't want to stop doing what we love, but traveling for an entire year, makes it quite difficult. Getting new clients and continue working, even for small projects, would require to settle for a while, a schedule and good connection. Although we did some projectes during the trip, building this blog was the perfect opportunity to still improving our skills in a super fun way.
