The mantra of LOLA is that they are a creative and strategically driven advertising agency with a Latin spirit and global reach. LOLA develops fully integrated, global campaigns, with people at the heart of every idea. The agency was already part of Lowe Group but with the business merge with Mullen, a huge american holding, they decided to redesign their online presence.

## Colorful yet meaningful design.

The color palette was nice but too diverse, instead of using it randomly we decided to organize the content by it. Each of the sections have it's own primary color and any other bit of content that's related to it, the same. Green for work, purple for about, yellow for culture and so on.

## More LOLA, everywhere.

Taking advantage of this *forced* redesign, LOLA took the content creation to a whole other level. The agency understood that writting more often about how they work or their culture as a place to work helps a lot on the business adquisition and on client's perspective of the agency. Of course, this can only be possible if the content is accessible from any device on Earth.
