The Car Configurator is the most important tool for both, consumers and automotive brands. It's one of the key touch points during the consumer journey at the time to buy a car, where the User starts to think in actual buying options and plays building and designing it's own desired machine. The platform is the most similar thing to an eCommerce but without the buying transaction, in that case the configuration itself serves as a final guide to go to the dealers and get the car.

## Complex nav, call to actions, legal disclaimers... But, what about the car?

The hardest part about working on this platform was to deal with all the elements that must be on the screen for other reasons than the User's needs. If all of information about the engines, equipment or upholsteries weren't enough to make the User interface dense and complex, adding disclaimers, offer overlays, special requierments for specific countries and many other non-related items made the team to rethink the way to design. The key was to display the less clutter as possible, putting content to the first place. Using full-bleed headers, small transitions and low contrast layouts, we build a more light and easy User interface.

## If we are in a mobile era, so is SEAT. Fully responsive design. 
Even knowing the huge complexity of the product, the team was challenged to transport all the functionality from desktop to mobile devices. As well as their new global website, the Car Configurator should be responsive to ensure a smooth experience between both.

## A true challenge, not only on the design perspective. 

As I mentioned in another <a href="/case/seat-global-website/">case</a>, SEAT is a company with huge ambitions but with a really slow-paced structure. Working with all the limitations that exist when you design for an international business and all their management is a tough task, anyway I'm very proud on the team's job.

This project was a shared venture between Lola & Huge. The development is still on going and it's been coded by Conleos.
