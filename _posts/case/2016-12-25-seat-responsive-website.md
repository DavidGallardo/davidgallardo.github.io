excerpt:     "In 2014 SEAT changed all its corporation values and strategy to refresh the user's perception of the brand. With this change, the digital ecosystem had to improve accordingly. LOLA got the opportunity and I joined the team to face one of my most challenging yet exciting projects: Designing a modular web system for all the different countries, adapting the car configuration to all new SEAT's technologies, creating an eCommerce to sell accessories, building a digital version for the car's manuals, among others."
