					I'm David, a designer based in Barcelona who likes to create interfaces that work beautifuly. I also love sports and I've been <a href="https://wefoundarobot.com">traveling</a> the world during 2017.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before that decision, I was working happily at <a href="http://lola-mullenlowe.com">LOLA</a> [MullenLowe Group] leading a small team of designers with a really big project in hands: Rethink & Improve the Global Digital Ecosystem of the largest Spanish automotive brand, SEAT.

					Even before, I was in a really cool company called <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/675629/">Mobivery</a>. There, I crafted tons of mobile applications for many clients & platforms. Also, I had the opportunity to work on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/2319614/">Malcom</a>, a SaaS for Mobile Marketing that combined push, analytics and a layer of BI.

					In the side, I taught design in schools like <a href="https://ironhack.com">Ironhack</a> or TheAppSchool; and directly to design teams inside companies like Schneider Electrics or TV3.
