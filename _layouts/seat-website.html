				SEAT is one of the major European brands in the automotive industry, as part of the Volkswagen group. In 2013 the company took a new strategic approach to change the people’s perception of the brand.  Lola [partnering with Huge at the begining] got the chance to develop this bold communication challenge.
			</p>
			<p>
				My role in the venture was to help redesign their entire digital ecosystem containing the Global Marketing Website, the Car Configurator, the Media Center, the Accessories eCommerce, the Online Manuals and many more. I ended leading the design team.

			<h2>It’s not just a website but a modular system to build one.</h2>
			<p>
				SEAT needed a platform for all the countries able to simply adapt a generic version of each page provided by the central team and at the same time, give them ability to create their own landings for any country-specific marketing purposes.
			</p>
			<p>
				The approach was to build a list of different and combinable modules with optional ui elements actionable from the CMS that would allow the publishers to build websites block by block.

			<h2>Different layouts for different purposes.</h2>
			<p>
				Apart from the modular system, our team designed some other templates for those pages that need to be more static and consistent over the time and to cover more complex tasks such as contact forms, test drives appointments, dealer search functionality or an article template for the corporate news.

			<h2>Learnings from working for a slow-paced international company.</h2>
			<p>
				Designing for a global brand like SEAT taught me many things about all the limitations you have designing for all the countries at the same time. We had to consider not only  different user behaviours or the importer willings about their annual objectives… also the different legal regulations of each region challenged the team to constantly adapt the layouts to always have more versatility to include statements or necessary data to pass the law.
